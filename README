Originally forked from https://github.com/brorson/ADC-001_basic_code

This repo is about playing around with ADC-001 A/D cape using Beaglebone Black Rev C.

'make' will create three executables of interest:

main.o - original tests of ADC cape
dsp_examples - program to record and analyze audio samples
dsp_examples_test - helper tests to keep dsp_examples in order (using https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)

More functionality and filters will be added soon!

Installation tips: 

1. the correct way to disable HDMI is to uncomment the following line in /boot/uEnv.txt:
disable_uboot_overlay_video=1

2. add following line to /etc/environment to enable correct work of gnuplot
export DISPLAY=:0
